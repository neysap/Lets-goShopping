E-commerce Back End Challenge README

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

In this code , I built the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The task is to ensure that the back end meets the provided acceptance criteria and technical requirements.

User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.
